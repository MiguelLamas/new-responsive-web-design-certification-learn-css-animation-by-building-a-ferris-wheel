# new-responsive-web-design-certification-learn-css-animation-by-building-a-ferris-wheel

Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

I wanted to practice how to use CSS animation to draw attention to specific sections of a webpage and make it more dynamic and engaging for the user.

I built a Ferris wheel to get a better understanding of how to use CSS to animate elements, transform them, and adjust their speed. 

- To animate I used a variety of properties including @keyframes rule with a transform property to define the flow of the CSS animation, and the animation-name property to link a @keyframes rule to a CSS selector. 
- Animation-duration to set how long the animation should take to complete. 
- Animation-iteration-count to set how many times my animation should repeat.
- Animation-timing-function property to set how the animation should progress over time.
